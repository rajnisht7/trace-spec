# Attestation Platforms

Hardware evidence can support TRACE Level 1. Level 2 additionally requires transparency anchoring; selecting a hardware platform does not establish either level by itself. A recipient must verify the evidence and its binding to the record-signing key.

## Platform names and evidence

Standalone TRACE records use the names in the [canonical schema](https://github.com/agentrust-io/trace-spec/blob/main/schema/trace-claim.json). Runtime configuration names such as cMCP's `sev-snp`, `tdx`, and `opaque` are not interchangeable with these wire values.

| [AMD SEV-SNP](https://trace.agentrust-io.com/docs/platforms/amd-sev-snp/index.md) | `amd-sev-snp` or the profile-specific `azure-cvm-sev-snp` | Signed SNP report, certificate chain, measurement, and key/challenge binding      |

| Software                                                                          | `software-only`                                           | Software signature and producer-defined commitments; no hardware assurance        |

The schema also registers other platform identifiers. Registration is not a claim that this Python SDK collects or appraises evidence for every platform.

## What the SDK checks

`agentrust_trace.verify_record` checks the standalone record's schema, profile, signature against a trusted key, freshness, and configured nonce/revocation inputs. It does not collect a hardware quote or turn a platform string into verified hardware evidence. There is no `agentrust-trace verify-hardware` command in this package.

Use a verifier for the producing runtime and evidence format. For cMCP's distinct `RuntimeClaim` envelope, follow [cMCP verification](https://cmcp.agentrust-io.com/tutorials/verifying-a-trace-claim/) and its [hardware-validation record](https://cmcp.agentrust-io.com/testing/hardware-validation/).
