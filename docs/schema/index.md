# Schema Reference

JSON Schema for the TRACE v0.2 Trust Record. Source: [`schema/trace-claim.json`](https://github.com/agentrust-io/trace-spec/blob/main/schema/trace-claim.json).

Every field typed `integer` here is bounded to -9007199254740991 through 9007199254740991, and no field is typed `number`. That is not a size limit on the data; it is what spec section 3.2.2 can canonicalize unambiguously, since RFC 8785 serializes numbers through an IEEE 754 double and two integers outside that range can share one. A value that needs to be larger is carried as a string. The same bound applies to members a `cnf.jwk` carries that this schema does not name.

## `data_class`

String. Sensitivity classification applied to the data processed in this session.

Defined values: `public`, `internal`, `confidential`, `restricted`, `secret`.

Custom values are allowed and should follow your organization's data classification policy.

Audit summary of tool invocations during the session.

| Field            | Type    | Required | Description                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `call_count`     | integer | **yes**  | Number of tool invocations recorded                           |
| `transcript_uri` | string  | no       | URI to the full per-call transcript (may be encrypted)        |

## `delegation`

A2A profile. Present when this execution acted on authority delegated by another agent; absent on a root (non-delegated) execution. A chain of records linked this way forms an offline-verifiable delegation DAG: a verifier walks `parent_record_hash` from a leaf record back to the root and confirms each hop acted under a credential in the delegation chain.

| Field                | Type   | Required | Description                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `parent_record_hash` | string | **yes**  | `sha256:`/`sha384:` digest of the parent hop's Trust Record  |
| `credential_id`      | string | **yes**  | Identifier of the delegation credential this hop acted under |

## `origin`

Absent means the runtime produced its own record, which is what every hardware profile is and what a consumer assumes. Present means something else assembled the record from evidence it did not itself measure.

It exists because `runtime.platform: "software-only"` is ambiguous on its own: it is the honest value for a dev-mode record, where nothing attested the execution, and for a record transcribed from another vendor's control plane, where the party asserting the evidence also wrote the log.

| Field             | Type    | Required | Description                                                               |
| ----------------- | ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kind`            | string  | **yes**  | `self`, `third-party-control-plane`, or `log-import`                      |
| `producer`        | string  | **yes**  | Identifier of the system that produced the source evidence                |
| `source_event_id` | string  | no       | Identifier of the source event in that system                             |
| `ingested_at`     | integer | no       | Unix time the evidence was ingested; `iat` is when this record was issued |

A record whose `kind` is not `self` **must** carry `runtime.platform: "software-only"`. An importer holding someone else's log has no quote to present, so a hardware platform on such a record is untrue rather than stronger. Both the reference model and `schema/trace-claim.json` reject the combination.

## `references`

An array of pointers to facts held outside this record: an authorization decided before execution, a human approval, a behavioural trace. What the signature attests is that this record points there, not the truth of what it points at.

`origin` records where evidence *came from* and can lower assurance. `references` records what a record *points at* and cannot. Before the block existed, a record that needed to name something external had to use `origin` and take `runtime.platform: "software-only"` with it, which said something untrue about how the evidence was obtained.

| Field       | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rel`       | string | **yes**  | Registered values: `authorized-intent`, `approval-outcome`, `behavior-trace`. A registry rather than a closed set, so the schema does not restrict which relation is named: only that one is: the value must be non-empty |
| `id`        | string | **yes**  | Identifier of the referenced fact within the resolver's system                                                                                                                                                            |
| `resolver`  | string | **yes**  | Identifier of the party obliged to resolve `id`                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `retention` | string | no       | ISO 8601 duration the resolver undertakes to keep `id` resolvable. An undertaking only; nothing enforces it                                                                                                               |
| `digest`    | string | no       | `sha256:` or `sha384:` digest of the referenced object, when the producer holds it at issue time                                                                                                                          |

`rel` is open where `origin.kind` is closed. Section 3.1.1 says `kind` is a closed set "because the value of the field is that a verifier can key on it"; section 3.1.2 calls `rel`'s values a registry and does not say that, so a new relation is a spec change and not also a schema change.

Spec section 3.1.2 also binds verifiers: one **must not** reject a record because an entry cannot be resolved, and **must not** treat a resolved entry as attested evidence. A reference that could invalidate a record would hand whoever controls the target a way to invalidate evidence they do not hold. Both are verifier behaviour, so neither the schema nor the reference model can enforce them; they are conformance-suite rules. What the schema and the model do enforce is the shape, and that a producer who cannot name a `resolver` cannot emit an empty one.

## `build_provenance`

Build-time provenance binding the deployed artifact.

| Field              | Type    | Required | Description                                                                                |

| `digest`           | string  | **yes**  | `sha256:` digest of the built artifact                                                     |
| `provenance_uri`   | string  | no       | URI to the SLSA provenance document (e.g., Rekor entry)                                    |
| `provenance_depth` | string  | no       | Depth the issuer claims: `surface`, `builder` or `transitive`. Absent is read as `surface` |

## `appraisal`

Verifier judgment on the evidence in this record.

| Field                       | Type    | Required | Description                                                            |

| `provenance_depth_verified` | string  | no       | Depth this verifier actually ran: `surface`, `builder` or `transitive` |

## `transparency`

String. URI of the SCITT transparency log entry anchoring this record. Omitted, or `null`, when the record is not anchored at issuance: anchoring may happen asynchronously. Never an empty string: the reference model rejects one (`min_length=1`).

## `cnf`

Confirmation method. Contains the signing key bound to this record.

| Field | Type   | Description                                      |
| ----- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `jwk` | object | JWK-format public key used to verify `signature` |

For TEE-issued records, this key was generated inside the measured enclave and its private half never leaves it. The hardware measurement in `runtime` cryptographically binds this key to the TEE.

## Wire formats

TRACE v0.2 supports two wire formats:

**JSON** (primary): signed JSON object with `signature` as a top-level field.

**CBOR-COSE** (constrained devices): COSE_Sign1 structure with TRACE claims as the payload. Defined in §3.2 of the spec: deferred to a future profile for constrained-device deployments.

## Example: AMD SEV-SNP
