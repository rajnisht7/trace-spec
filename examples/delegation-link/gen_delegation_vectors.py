"""Generate delegation-link conformance vectors for the proposed A2A profile.

The `delegation` block is normative in v0.2: `schema/trace-claim.json` requires
`parent_record_hash` and `credential_id`, and pins the first to a sha256/sha384
digest string. What a verifier is supposed to *do* with a chain of them is not
normative anywhere. `spec/trace-v0.2.md` never mentions either field; the only
prose is `docs/schema.md`, which says a verifier "walks `parent_record_hash` from
a leaf record back to the root and confirms each hop acted under a credential in
the delegation chain" — one sentence, no rules. `ROADMAP.md` targets the normative
A2A profile at v0.3.

These vectors encode the rules proposed in `docs/rfcs/a2a-delegation-profile.md`,
so that the proposal can be argued against executable material rather than in the
abstract. Each vector is a complete record set plus the verifier context it must
be judged under, and carries its own expected classification and codes. Nothing
here is normative until the proposal is.

Three things were settled while building this set, each because a vector could not
be written without settling it. They are the reason the corpus exists at this
stage rather than after the profile is written:

**The digest preimage.** "Digest of the parent hop's Trust Record" does not say
which bytes. Over the RFC 8785 encoding of the complete record, signature
included, or over the signed body only? The two readings are both natural and
they are not interoperable — a chain built under one is a chain of dangling links
under the other. The profile takes the complete record, because under the other
reading a child's commitment does not bind the parent's *signer*: anyone may
re-sign identical body bytes under a different key and produce a record the child
still points at. Vector 05 is that difference and nothing else.

**Cycles cannot be built.** A cycle would need A's block to carry a digest of B
while B's carries a digest of A, and each digest covers the block holding the
other, so constructing one is a hash collision. The profile therefore has no
cycle rule and says why; what it does need is a depth bound, because an
*unbounded* chain is constructible and a walk without a limit is a denial of
service. That is `depth_exceeded`, and it is the only reason the bound exists.

**Only the leaf's signature is independently attackable.** Every ancestor's bytes
are already committed to by its child, so a record cannot be altered in place
without breaking the link that names it. An ancestor with an invalid signature is
still reachable — it just has to be built that way from the start rather than
tampered with afterwards — which is why `sign_key` is a build-time parameter here
and no vector is produced by mutating a finished chain.

**The digest is over UTF-16 code-unit key order, not code-point order.** Section
3.1.3 states that the two orderings agree across the Basic Multilingual Plane and
diverge only once an object key contains a supplementary-plane character, and that
every vector in this corpus was ASCII and so could not tell an implementation that
takes the code-point shortcut from one that computes RFC 8785 correctly. Vector 24
is the vector that spec paragraph names as missing: its root's `cnf.jwk` carries
extra members keyed by a BMP private-use character and by a character outside the
Basic Multilingual Plane, which sort in opposite relative order under the two
schemes. The chain is otherwise exactly vector 01's.

Keys derive from one published seed, per role, so the whole set regenerates
byte-for-byte and a third party can reissue any of it. Public test material with
no secret in it.
