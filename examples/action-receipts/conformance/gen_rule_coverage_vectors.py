"""Rule-coverage vectors for the receipt verifier: 10-16, and the second set 17-30.

10-16 close the seven receipt rules the conformance set never exercised (merged
upstream as PR #122): each triggers exactly one rule that previously had no vector
behind it.

17-30 give **every** receipt rule a second, independent vector (upstream #124: at
least two independent vectors per rule, where two vectors are independent if a single
implementation defect causes one to pass and the other to fail). Each second vector is
adversarially placed against a specific implementation shortcut its partner cannot
detect: digests that agree with the expected value through the first sixteen hex
characters but not after, identifiers that differ only by case, freshness violations
of exactly one second, a structurally well-formed signature of the wrong length, and
a receipt that is explicitly ``null`` rather than absent. The defect each pair is
split by is declared in ``tests/test_vector_completeness.py::DEFECTS`` and enforced
there.

The 01-09 fixtures pin a key whose private half is not published, so everything here
pins its own deterministic test key. Public JWKs only.
