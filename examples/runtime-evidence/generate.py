"""Corpus generator and reference rule implementation for the runtime-evidence profile.

Informative. Binds nothing until `docs/rfcs/runtime-evidence-profile.md` is adopted.

Every vector here is built around a GENUINE Intel TDX v4 quote captured from a GCP C3
confidential VM on 2026-07-21, committed at
`agentrust-io/agent-manifest:python/tests/fixtures/hardware/gcp-tdx-2026-07-21/`.
No quote in this corpus is minted. A synthetic quote is built to the parser's own idea
of the layout, so a corpus made of them measures a parser against itself.

Two real captures matter more than one. They come from a single TD, so they share an
MRTD, and they carry different REPORT_DATA bindings. That is what makes the
substitution vector meaningful: both quotes verify on their own, and a rule set that
accepts a valid quote without binding it to the record accepts the swap.
