"""Generate canonicalization boundary vectors (spec section 3.2.2).

The spec: "Implementations MUST use an RFC 8785-conformant library. Using
`json.dumps(sort_keys=True)` (Python) or equivalent ad-hoc sorting is insufficient."
No published test material exercised that sentence: every existing record is
ASCII-only with schema-fixed keys, and on such records every ad-hoc serializer agrees
with RFC 8785 byte-for-byte, so an implementation using one passes everything.

These are the records on which they disagree. Each is schema-valid and correctly
signed over its RFC 8785 bytes, and each carries ``diverges_under`` — the ad-hoc
canonicalizations whose output differs, so that a verifier built on them computes
different bytes and rejects a valid record. ``tests/test_canonicalization_boundary.py``
recomputes that list rather than trusting it.

The ad-hoc forms make a ladder, each rung needing a sharper vector to expose:

- ``sort_keys_default`` — ``json.dumps(record, sort_keys=True)``. Inserts spaces after
  separators; any record at all diverges.
- ``sort_keys_compact`` — adds ``separators=(",", ":")``. Correct on ASCII; escapes
  non-ASCII as ``\\uXXXX`` where RFC 8785 emits literal UTF-8.
- ``sort_keys_compact_utf8`` — adds ``ensure_ascii=False``. Correct on every record in
  this repository except one: RFC 8785 sorts object keys by UTF-16 code units, Python
  sorts str by code point, and the two orders differ exactly when a key contains a
  supplementary-plane character.

There is no vector for RFC 8785's IEEE 754 number serialization. No v0.2 field is typed
``number``, every integer field is held to the range RFC 8785 Appendix B note 1 names,
and the members a JWK may carry without this schema naming them are held to the same
range, so a record that reaches the number divergence is schema-invalid and no positive
vector can carry it. ``tests/test_canonicalization_boundary.py`` pins all three.

Deterministic key, so the set regenerates byte-for-byte. Public test material.
